Book Notes is a project where the openlibrary.org API is used to put the covers of the books that are added to the database. In addition to adding books and deleting them, we can modify parts of the review or rating. And finally, we can also organize the books by alphabetical order, by date of the review and by rating. To start the application: <br>

2- Use 'npm i' to install dependencies and 'node index.js' to start application. <br>
3- Use the address "http://localhost:3000/" on your browser to use app.
